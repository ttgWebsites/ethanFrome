					<li data-theme="d">The novel, set in the town of Starkfield, Massachusetts, tells the story of Ethan Frome.  
					Frome's tragic story is told from the viewpoint of another man who meets Frome some twenty years after the story takes place.
					Frome was living with his wife Zeena in a very depressing relationship. He had desires for Zeena's cousin and hoped 
					that one day he could leave Zeena behind and settle down with her instead. An ill-fated decision however leads Frome 
					nd Mattie, Zeena's cousin, to severely injure themselves on a sled when they had intended to kill themselves instead and 
					escape their miserable lives. Instead Mattie is left paralyzed and now Zeena is forced to take care of her and Frome all 
					the way to the day the novel begins. Frome's story is one of great tragedy and great irony; he desires to better his life, 
					yet cant so instead chooses to take it. Instead he makes his life significantly worse and he never achieves what he desires.</li>
